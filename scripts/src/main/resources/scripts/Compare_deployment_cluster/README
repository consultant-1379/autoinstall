This script compares expected values in a deployment script to properties listed in a cluster file,
printing out any values expected by the deployment script that are not found in the cluster file.

To run, simply provide a deployment script and cluster file as arguments, i.e:

$	python compare_deployment_cluster.py deployment_script.sh cluster_file.sh

NOTE: Hasn't been tested extensively as I only needed it for one or two files at time
of writing. If you're having trouble with/experiencing weird behaviour drop
me a line and I'll make some improvements.
