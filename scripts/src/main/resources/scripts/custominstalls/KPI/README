PERFORMANCE KPIs
================

STEPS
-----
- Install the ST-CDB System through FEM Jenkins 

- Specify the deployment file and cluster file in this directory.

- Set "Deployment Script Type" to be XML Merge

- Specify "pm_kpi" in the testTags section.

- Ensure OS Patches are not selected

KPI Measurements
----------------
(If there is a large difference from the previous sprints values - then it may be necessary to run the commands multiple times to confirm.)

The required metrics to be detailed in Confluence page : 

 https://confluence-nam.lmera.ericsson.se/display/ELITP/Performance+KPIs


The majority of metrics are taken from the KPI Tests run - TC01 and TC02.

The metrics for create_plan, show_plan and run_plan are taken from the console log of the ST-CDB job : 


NOTE: Some of the operations are executed a number of times in sequence, the times should always be gathered from the very last execution for consistency.
